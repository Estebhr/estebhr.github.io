## Header

My interests revolve around the areas of psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology. Specifically, I'm interested in the cognitive and neural basis of bilingual speech production, code-switching and how linguistic, contextual and individual experiences interact with this process. I have also worked on various other projects on the topics of online and blended education, multicultural and emotional assesment, reading comprehension and executive functions.
